# Avdar

This is a toy physics library for game prototyping, written in
[Zig](https://ziglang.org). I created this library to support my
[zamgba](https://github.com/fuzhouch/zamgba) SDK for Gameboy Advance
programming.

Avdar is a small library, not ready for production yet. For now
I use it for self-study purpose.
