# Avdar

This is a toy physics library for game prototyping, written in
[Zig](https://ziglang.org). I created this library to support my
[zamgba](https://github.com/fuzhouch/zamgba) SDK for Gameboy Advance
programming. It targets GBA programming as top priority, while it
also tries to cover programming in PC.


By today (2025/07), Avdar is a toy project for self study purpose.
It reflects my learning progress of
[Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768)
by Ian Millington.

For anyone who is also interested in learning physics development,
